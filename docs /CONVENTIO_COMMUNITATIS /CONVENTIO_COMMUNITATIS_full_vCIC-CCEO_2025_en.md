### ✝️ Ecclesiastical Legal Framework (binding)

---

### ✝️ Reference to Canon Law and Catholic Social Teaching  

This agreement is consistent with the *Codex Iuris Canonici (CIC)*  
and the *Codex Canonum Ecclesiarum Orientalium (CCEO)*,  
as well as the principles of **truth, justice, solidarity, subsidiarity, and responsibility for creation.**  

It unites spiritual and civil law:  
Divine law (*CIC* can. 1752 – “*Salus animarum suprema lex esto*” – *The salvation of souls shall be the supreme law*)  
stands above all provisions,  
while the civil regulations of the German Civil Code (*BGB*) ensure legal validity.  

Thus, the agreement serves the dual purpose of  
🕊️ **the salvation of souls and the well-being of creation.**

---

### ✝️ Selection of Canonical Legal Basis (mandatory)

Before signing, one of the following legal bases **must be selected**:

- [ ] **Option A – Supplementary (CIC):**  
  In addition to German civil law (BGB), the principles of the *Codex Iuris Canonici (CIC)*  
  apply supplementarily, insofar as they serve the aims of this agreement and do not conflict with civil law.  

- [ ] **Option B – Supplementary (CCEO):**  
  In addition to German civil law (BGB), the principles of the *Codex Canonum Ecclesiarum Orientalium (CCEO)*  
  apply supplementarily, insofar as they serve the aims of this agreement and do not conflict with civil law.  

- [ ] **Option C – Fully Canonical (CIC):**  
  This agreement is interpreted and applied fully under the *Codex Iuris Canonici (CIC)*  
  and applicable diocesan regulations.  

- [ ] **Option D – Fully Canonical (CCEO):**  
  This agreement is interpreted and applied fully under the *Codex Canonum Ecclesiarum Orientalium (CCEO)*  
  and applicable ecclesiastical norms.  

🕊️ **Note:**  
If no option is selected, the agreement is **considered incomplete and invalid.**
