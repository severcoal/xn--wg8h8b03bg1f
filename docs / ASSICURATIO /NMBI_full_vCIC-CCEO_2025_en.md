# 🌍 Non-Monetary Balance Insurance (NMBI)
*Based on the principles of contractual freedom (§§ 241 et seq. of the German Civil Code – BGB), in the spirit of the Insurance Contract Act (VVG).*

---

## § 1 Preamble
In recognition of the natural balance between giving and receiving, the undersigned enter into this agreement.  
It serves the mutual protection, care, and restoration of equilibrium between persons, beings, things, or ideas — **without the use of money or money-like means.**

---

## § 2 Parties
1. **Policyholder (👤)** — any person who holds or safeguards a protected element (*the Sustaining Element*).  
2. **Insurer (🏡)** — the community of participants who collectively provide compensation in the event of loss, damage, or transformation.  
3. **Co-insured (👨‍👩‍👧‍👦)** — all those who take part in the exchange of goods, actions, knowledge, or energy.

---

## § 3 Insured Object
1. All forms of value or significance may be insured, including:  
   - living beings (e.g. 🦙, 🌳, 🐝),  
   - objects and resources (e.g. 🚘, 🏡, 🌾),  
   - works, ideas, and projects (e.g. 💡, 📚, 🎨),  
   - relationships and social bonds (e.g. 🤝, 🌐).  
2. The insured element (*Sustaining Element*) serves the preservation of life, usefulness, or meaning within the community.

---

## § 4 Insurance Event
1. An insurance event occurs when the Sustaining Element:  
   - a) suffers damage, loss, impairment, or death (*💀*), or  
   - b) produces excessive benefit, yield, or surplus (*🥛🍞🥔*) that must be shared.  
2. In the first case (loss), a right to compensation arises; in the second (surplus), a duty to share arises.  
3. The policyholder shall notify the community as soon as the event occurs.

---

## § 5 Benefits
1. Benefits are provided **not in money**, but in **acts, gifts, or shares**, such as:  
   - labor, care, companionship,  
   - transfer of knowledge, energy, or tools,  
   - sharing of harvests, materials, or shelter.  
2. The community jointly decides how compensation is to be made to restore balance.  
3. A benefit is deemed fulfilled once its usefulness to the recipient becomes apparent.

---

## § 6 Contributions
1. Contributions consist of recurring acts of care, responsibility, or service.  
2. The type of contribution (e.g. time, knowledge, space, labor) is determined collectively.  
3. Contributions express participation — not valuation.  
4. Those who contribute acquire the right to assistance in their own insurance event.

---

## § 7 Duties of the Participants
1. All participants commit to maintaining balance through sincere giving and responsible receiving.  
2. The policyholder shall protect the Sustaining Element as long as it exists.  
3. The insurer (community) commits to act appropriately after loss, change, or death (*💀*), enabling remembrance, compensation, or renewal (*🕊️*).

---

## § 8 Duration and Termination
1. The contract begins with the inclusion of the Sustaining Element into the community.  
2. It ends when no giving or receiving takes place, or when equilibrium permanently ceases.  
3. Dissolution may occur only by mutual agreement of all participants.

---

## § 9 Mediation and Validity
1. Disputes regarding contributions, benefits, or balance shall first be resolved collectively.  
2. If no agreement can be reached, the community’s internal arbitration procedure applies.  
3. If any clause is found invalid, the remaining provisions shall remain effective.

### ✝️ Ecclesiastical Legal Framework (binding)

---

### ✝️ Reference to Canon Law and Catholic Social Teaching
This agreement is in harmony with the principles of the *Codex Iuris Canonici (CIC)*  
and the *Catholic Social Teaching*, particularly the values of  
**truth, justice, solidarity, subsidiarity, and responsibility for creation.**

It unites spiritual and civil law:  
Divine law (*CIC* can. 1752 – “*Salus animarum suprema lex esto*”)  
serves as the guiding principle above all provisions,  
while the civil regulations of the German Civil Code (*BGB*) ensure legal validity.  

Thus, the agreement serves a dual purpose:  
🕊️ **the salvation of souls and the well-being of creation.**

---

## ✝️ Selection of Ecclesiastical Legal Basis (mandatory)

Before signing, one of the following legal frameworks must be **explicitly selected**:

### **Latin Church (CIC)**
- [ ] **A1 – Supplementary (CIC + BGB):**  
  In addition to German civil law (BGB), the principles of Catholic Canon Law  
  (*Codex Iuris Canonici*, CIC) apply **supplementarily**, insofar as they serve the purpose of this agreement and do not conflict with civil provisions.  

- [ ] **B1 – Fully Canonical (CIC):**  
  This agreement is governed **entirely** by the provisions of the *CIC* and relevant diocesan regulations.  
  Civil law provisions (BGB) apply **subsidiarily**, insofar as they do not contradict Canon Law.  

---

### **Eastern Catholic Churches (CCEO)**
- [ ] **A2 – Supplementary (CCEO + BGB):**  
  In addition to German civil law (BGB), the principles of the *Codex Canonum Ecclesiarum Orientalium* (CCEO) apply **supplementarily**,  
  insofar as they serve the purpose of this agreement and do not conflict with civil provisions.  

- [ ] **B2 – Fully Canonical (CCEO):**  
  This agreement is governed **entirely** by the provisions of the *CCEO* and the respective laws of the *sui iuris* Church.  
  Civil law provisions (BGB) apply **subsidiarily**, insofar as they do not contradict Eastern Canon Law.  

🕊️ **Note:**  
Without the clear selection of one of these four options (A1–B2), this agreement is considered **not concluded**.

---

### ✝️ Mixed Parties (CIC + CCEO)
If parties belong to both the Latin and an Eastern Catholic Church,  
the contract is interpreted **jointly under the principles of both codes (CIC + CCEO)**,  
taking into account the jurisdiction of the competent ecclesiastical authority.  

> *Salus animarum suprema lex esto* – *The salvation of souls shall be the supreme law.*

---

### 🖋️ Validity and Signature Requirement
This agreement enters into force only if:  
1. One of the above variants (A1–B2) has been clearly selected, **and**  
2. All three parties have signed personally:  

- 👤 **Policyholder / Holder / Initiator**  
- 🏡 **Community / Insurer / Representative**  
- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 **Co-insured / Witnesses / Participants**

If any of these signatures or the legal selection is missing,  
the agreement is deemed **not concluded and legally invalid** (§§ 145–147, 154 BGB).
