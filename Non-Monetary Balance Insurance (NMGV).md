## § 1 Preamble  
In recognition of the natural balance between giving and receiving, the undersigned enter into this agreement.  
It serves the mutual protection, care, and restoration of equilibrium between persons, beings, things, or ideas — **without the use of money or money-like means**.

---

## § 2 Parties  
1. **Policyholder (👤)** – any person who holds or safeguards a protected element (*the Sustaining Element*).  
2. **Insurer (🏡)** – the community of participants who collectively provide compensation in the event of loss, damage, or transformation.  
3. **Co-insured (👨‍👩‍👧‍👦)** – all those who take part in the exchange of goods, actions, knowledge, or energy.

---

## § 3 Insured Object  
1. All forms of value or significance may be insured, including:  
   - living beings (e.g. 🦙, 🌳, 🐝),  
   - objects and resources (e.g. 🚘, 🏡, 🌾),  
   - works, ideas, and projects (e.g. 💡, 📚, 🎨),  
   - relationships and social bonds (e.g. 🤝, 🌐).  
2. The insured element (*Sustaining Element*) serves the preservation of life, usefulness, or meaning within the community.

---

## § 4 Insurance Event  
1. An insurance event occurs when the Sustaining Element:  
   - a) suffers damage, loss, impairment, or death (*💀*), or  
   - b) produces excessive benefit, yield, or surplus (*🥛🍞🥔*) that must be shared.  
2. In the first case (loss), a right to compensation arises; in the second (surplus), a duty to share arises.  
3. The policyholder shall notify the community as soon as the event occurs.

---

## § 5 Benefits  
1. Benefits are provided **not in money**, but in **acts, gifts, or shares**, such as:  
   - labor, care, companionship,  
   - transfer of knowledge, energy, or tools,  
   - sharing of harvests, materials, or shelter.  
2. The community jointly decides how compensation is to be made to restore balance.  
3. A benefit is deemed fulfilled once its usefulness to the recipient becomes apparent.

---

## § 6 Contributions  
1. Contributions consist of recurring acts of care, responsibility, or service.  
2. The type of contribution (e.g. time, knowledge, space, labor) is determined collectively.  
3. Contributions express participation — not valuation.  
4. Those who contribute acquire the right to assistance in their own insurance event.

---

## § 7 Duties of the Participants  
1. All participants commit to maintaining balance through sincere giving and responsible receiving.  
2. The policyholder shall protect the Sustaining Element as long as it exists.  
3. The insurer (community) commits to act appropriately after loss, change, or death (*💀*), enabling remembrance, compensation, or renewal (*🕊️*).

---

## § 8 Duration and Termination  
1. The contract begins with the inclusion of the Sustaining Element into the community.  
2. It ends when no giving or receiving takes place, or when equilibrium permanently ceases.  
3. Dissolution may occur only by mutual agreement of all participants.

---

## § 9 Mediation and Validity  
1. Disputes regarding contributions, benefits, or balance shall first be resolved collectively.  
2. If no agreement can be reached, the community’s internal arbitration procedure applies.  
3. If any clause is found invalid, the remaining provisions shall remain effective.
