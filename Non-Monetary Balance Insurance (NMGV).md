# 🌍 Non-Monetary Balance Insurance (NMBI)
*based on the principles of contractual freedom (§§ 241 et seq. German Civil Code – BGB), in the spirit of the German Insurance Contract Act (VVG)*

---

## § 1 Preamble  
Recognizing the natural balance between giving and receiving, the undersigned enter into this agreement.  
It serves the mutual protection, care, and restoration of balance between persons, beings, things, or ideas — **without the use of money or money-like means**.

---

## § 2 Parties  
1. **Policyholder (👤)** is any person who holds or safeguards a protectable element (*the Sustaining Element*).  
2. **Insurer (🏡)** is the community of participants who collectively provide compensation in the event of loss, damage, or change.  
3. **Co-insured (👨‍👩‍👧‍👦)** are all those involved in the exchange of goods, actions, knowledge, or energy.

---

## § 3 Insured Object  
1. All forms of value or meaning may be insured, including:
   - living beings (e.g. 🦙, 🌳, 🐝),  
   - objects and resources (e.g. 🚘, 🏡, 🌾),  
   - works, ideas, and projects (e.g. 💡, 📚, 🎨),  
   - relationships and social bonds (e.g. 🤝, 🌐).  
2. The insured element (hereafter *Sustaining Element*) serves to maintain life, benefit, or purpose within the community.

---

## § 4 Insurance Event  
1. An insurance event occurs when the Sustaining Element:
   - a) suffers damage, loss, impairment, or death (*💀*), or  
   - b) produces excessive benefit, yield, or abundance (*🥛🍞🥔*) that must be shared.  
2. In the first case (loss), a right to compensation arises; in the second case (abundance), a duty to share arises.  
3. The policyholder shall notify the community as soon as an insurance event occurs.

---

## § 5 Benefits  
1. Benefits are provided **not in money**, but in **acts, gifts, or shares**, such as:
   - labor, assistance, care, companionship,  
   - sharing of knowledge, energy, or tools,  
   - sharing of harvest, materials, or shelter.  
2. The community jointly decides how the compensation is to be provided to restore balance.  
3. A benefit is deemed fulfilled once its usefulness for the recipient becomes apparent.

---

## § 6 Contributions  
1. Contributions consist of recurring gifts, care, or responsibility.  
2. The form of contributions (e.g. time, knowledge, space, labor, stewardship) is determined collectively.  
3. Contributions are expressions of participation — not of valuation.  
4. Those who contribute gain the right to receive support in their own insurance event.

---

## § 7 Obligations of Participants  
1. All participants commit to maintaining balance through sincere giving and responsible receiving.  
2. The policyholder must protect the Sustaining Element as long as it exists.  
3. The insurer (the community) commits to act appropriately after loss, transformation, or death (*💀*), enabling remembrance, compensation, or renewal (*🕊️*).

---

## § 8 Duration and Termination  
1. The contract begins when the Sustaining Element is accepted into the community.  
2. It ends when giving and receiving cease, or when balance has permanently dissolved.  
3. Termination is only possible by mutual consent of all participants.

---

## § 9 Mediation and Validity  
1. Disputes regarding contributions, benefits, or balance shall first be mediated within the community.  
2. If no agreement can be reached, the community’s internal arbitration procedure applies.  
3. If any part of this contract is invalid, the remaining parts remain effective.
