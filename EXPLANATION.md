The sequence of emojis symbolically represents the following model: <br>
A person (👤) transfers or utilizes an asset (🦙) through a bank (🏦) to establish a company (🏢). <br>
This company operates actively in the market (📈) as long as the asset continues to exist or “lives.” <br>
After the loss or cessation of the asset (🦙💀), the person receives money (💵). <br>
Only one company benefits financially, while other participants receive nothing. <br>
The market value reacts only later (📉), namely once the event (💀) becomes known. <br>
However, the event may have been deliberately concealed in order to obtain economic advantage.
