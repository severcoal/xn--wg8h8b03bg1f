between
[Name, Address] – hereinafter referred to as the “Grantor” –
and
the Community [designation or names of the members], represented by [Representative, Address], – hereinafter referred to as the “Community” –
the following Agreement is entered into:
Section 1 – Subject Matter of the Agreement
(1) The Grantor grants the Community the right to use and cultivate the property or estate owned or otherwise legally possessed by the Grantor, described as [location, parcel number, boundaries, etc.].
(2) The purpose of this grant is the communal use and cultivation of the property for self-sufficiency — including the production, processing, and distribution of food and other goods for the members’ own needs.
(3) The grant is made free of charge unless otherwise provided in this Agreement.
(4) The Grantor retains ownership of the property and may revoke the right of use in cases of serious breach of this Agreement.
Section 2 – Communal Cultivation and Participation
(1) The Community shall cultivate and manage the property independently within the framework of this Agreement, with all yields, harvests, and resources to be distributed jointly among members.
(2) The products produced (including food, seeds, and supplies) shall be divided according to the rules of distribution set out in an annex or internal community regulation.
(3) The Community shall treat the property with due care, prevent damage, and establish reasonable reserves or compensation mechanisms in case of crop failure.
(4) The Community shall not make any permanent structural changes or dispose of any part of the property without the prior written consent of the Grantor.
Section 3 – Duration of the Grant / Death of the Animal
(1) The right of use remains valid as long as the animal specified in this Agreement (🦙) is alive.
(2) Upon the death of the animal, the gratuitous right of use shall automatically terminate, without the need for separate notice.
(3) Upon termination, the yields, harvests, and supplies of the property shall, for a period of [e.g., 12 months], be distributed as follows:
 a) [e.g., a fixed share or percentage] shall pass to the Grantor;
 b) The remaining portion shall be distributed among the members of the Community according to the established distribution rules.
(4) The Community shall notify the Grantor in writing within [e.g., one month] after the death of the animal and ensure the proper transfer of yields as agreed.
(5) The intentional or fraudulent concealment of the animal’s death constitutes a material breach of contract and entitles the Grantor to claim damages and revoke the right of use with immediate effect.
Section 4 – Balance, Reciprocity, and Transparency
(1) Both Parties acknowledge that this relationship is based on the principle of mutual exchange and balance — giving and receiving shall remain in sustainable equilibrium.
(2) Each Party shall contribute to maintaining the property and achieving the collective objectives in good faith.
(3) The Community shall operate transparently and provide the Grantor with periodic reports (at least [e.g., annually or semi-annually]) concerning production, management, yields, damages, and reserves.
(4) Each Party may request access to management documents, records, inventories, and relevant financial statements.
Section 5 – Liability and Breach of Obligations
(1) The Community shall be liable for any damage to the property resulting from gross negligence or willful misconduct.
(2) Liability for slight negligence shall be limited to foreseeable and typical damages within the scope of this Agreement.
(3) Failure to provide mandatory information or concealment of the animal’s death entitles the Grantor to terminate the Agreement immediately and claim compensation for any resulting loss.
Section 6 – Commemoration and Cultural Preservation
(1) Upon the death of the animal, both Parties undertake to commemorate its significance in an appropriate and dignified manner.
(2) The form of remembrance (e.g., ceremony, planting, inscription, or symbolic act) shall be decided by the Community.
(3) This clause serves a symbolic and cultural purpose and does not in itself create any financial or proprietary obligations.
Section 7 – Revocation, Termination, and Restitution
(1) The Grantor may terminate the right of use for cause, particularly in the event of material breach of this Agreement by the Community.
(2) After termination, the Community shall cease all use of the property and return or transfer all yields or assets due within [e.g., one month].
(3) Any claims for compensation or restitution remain unaffected.
Section 8 – Miscellaneous and Final Provisions
(1) Amendments or additions to this Agreement must be made in writing. This also applies to any waiver of the written form requirement.
(2) If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, the validity of the remaining provisions shall remain unaffected. The Parties shall agree on a valid provision that best reflects the original intent.
(3) This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany. Place of jurisdiction is [City].
(4) The Agreement shall enter into force upon signature by both Parties.
