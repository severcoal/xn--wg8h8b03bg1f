### ✝️ Ecclesiastical Legal Framework

---

### ✝️ Reference to Canon Law and Catholic Social Teaching

This agreement is in harmony with the principles of the *Codex Iuris Canonici*  
and the Catholic Social Teaching, particularly the values of  
**truth, justice, solidarity, subsidiarity, and responsibility for creation**.  

It unites spiritual and civil law:  
Divine law (*CIC* can. 1752 – “*Salus animarum suprema lex esto*” – *The salvation of souls shall be the supreme law*)  
serves as the guiding principle above all provisions,  
while the civil regulations of the German Civil Code (*BGB*) ensure legal validity.  

Thus, the agreement serves a dual purpose:  
🕊️ **the salvation of souls and the well-being of creation.**

---

Please check which interpretation shall apply to this agreement:

- [ ] **Option A – Supplementary:**  
  In addition to German civil law (BGB), the principles of Catholic Canon Law  
  (*Codex Iuris Canonici*, CIC, in its current version) shall apply **supplementarily**,  
  insofar as they serve the purpose of this agreement and do not conflict with civil provisions.  

- [ ] **Option B – Fully Canonical:**  
  This agreement is to be interpreted and applied under the provisions of the  
  *Codex Iuris Canonici (CIC)* and the respective diocesan regulations,  
  insofar as they are binding for ecclesiastical institutions or recognized Church projects.  
  Civil law provisions (BGB) apply **subsidiarily**, insofar as they do not contradict Canon Law.

**Place, Date:** ___________________
