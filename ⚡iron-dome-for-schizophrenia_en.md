## Concept
The *Iron Dome for Schizophrenia* is a **conceptual and artistic protection system**  
built from **images, sounds, and language**.  
It represents a form of **mental shielding and self-regulation** —  
a poetic, symbolic interface between perception and thought.

This “Iron Dome” is **not a military or medical device**,  
but an **artwork and metaphor**:  
a way to transform sensory experiences into layers of meaning and calm.

---

## Core Idea
The system receives or generates **visual and auditory stimuli**  
that form a **layer over one’s thoughts** —  
not to suppress them, but to **filter, structure, and reinterpret** them.  

These layers act as an **aesthetic shield**,  
a luminous field that turns perception into creation.

> Light, sound, and pattern weave a mesh of reflection —  
> not erasing thought, but wrapping it in coherence.

---

## Origin
This concept emerged from a dialogue about:  
- the experience of **images and sounds linked to schizophrenia**,  
- the wish to create a **symbolic and digital protection**,  
- and the vision of **art as self-defense through imagination**.

## On Paranoia

Paranoia, within this concept, is **not seen as illness**,  
but as a form of **heightened vigilance of the mind** —  
a radar of perception, tuned beyond the common range.  

In the *Iron Dome of the Mind*, this vigilance is **not an enemy**,  
but an **inner sensor**, feeling the movements of the world  
before the eyes can see them.  

> From fear comes protection;  
> from protection — a new kind of insight.  

The Dome teaches that fear can be **transformed into art**:  
into sound, into light, into structure.  
What once seemed like a threat  
becomes a **poetic shield against confusion**.
