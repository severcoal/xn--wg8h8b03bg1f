The scheme described herein must be structured and applied in a manner that does not permit concealment, circumvention of reporting obligations, or any other unlawful conduct. In particular, the following are prohibited:
Concealment of facts material to legal, tax or supervisory authorities (e.g., changes in beneficial ownership, deaths, suspicious activity),
Circumvention of statutory reporting obligations (including anti-money-laundering obligations and suspicious-activity reporting to authorities),
Conducting activities without required supervisory or regulatory authorizations (e.g., under banking or securities laws), or without tax clearance, and
Any act intended to mislead counterparties, banks, supervisory authorities or other third parties.
Use of the model for the purpose or with the effect of circumventing legal obligations is expressly forbidden. Persons or entities that apply the model to conceal or evade legal rules act unlawfully and face civil, criminal and regulatory liability.
Prior to implementation, obtain mandatory legal review by specialized counsel (banking/capital markets/tax law) and, if applicable, coordinate with relevant supervisory and tax authorities.
